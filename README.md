# Week 2 Exam
This week is a culmination of our learnings on RecyclerView and
Retrofit. This exam is a test to see whether you've learned how to
use Retrofit correctly.

## Task 1
Find RickAndMorty episodes
 - Create a separate branch off of develop called `features/{username}`
 - Push your branch `features/{username}` to remote
 - Then create a branch off of your branch called `features/{username}/task1`
 - Build a repository and retrofit instance that allows you to call
    [Rick and Morty Episodes API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#get-all-episodes)
 - The repository should allow you to fetch all episodes
 - Please log the requests and responses so it can be read in the logcat
 - You only need to create a working repository that can fetch the episodes
 - Open a PR against your branch `features/{username}`

## Task 2
 - Create a branch off of your first task called `features/{username}/task2`
 - Implement a viewmodel, adapter, and recyclerview to display the list of episodes
 - You should display the name, episode, and the date it was aired
 - When you click on the card, it should open a web browswer with the url of the episode
 - Open a PR against your branch `features/{username}/task1`
